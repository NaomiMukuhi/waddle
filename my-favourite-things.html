    <p>my favourite foods would be any food without red meat as a part of the dish
        but some of my most favourite would be, chapati with some stew and or soup
        rice with chicken,[chicken is white meat] or briyani, prefferably bit spicy too
        and lastly would be cold yogurt as a snack would do.
